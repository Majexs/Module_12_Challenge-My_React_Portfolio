This page has been deployed to Render, but if you want to make changes then be sure to download the repo locally from my GitHub page (just be sure to give me credit). See attached screenshots for samples of the website!
## Credits
This project was built from scrath, but I utilized some examples from the bootcamp activities, as well as referred to ChatGPT for specific techniques. Finally, for basic styling I used Bootstrap.

## Features
While basic styling has been implemented, with more time I would like to go back and customize the styling even further to have a smoother and more unique aesthetic.
